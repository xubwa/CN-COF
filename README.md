# CN-COF
Geometry file for CN-COF paper

The repository is organized as follow:
There are three directories named 'CN-COF1', 'CN-COF2' and 'CN-COF3' related to the three COFs in this work.
In each directory, the CN-COF${i}.xyz is the optimized geometry of the fragment itself.
The CN-COF${i}_CO2.xyz is the optimized geometry of the fragment adsorbs a CO2 molecule, CN-COF${i}_N2 is the optimized geometry of the fragrament adsorbs a N2 molecule.
